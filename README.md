# IWE - Markdown LSP server

![Demo](readme.iwe/demo.gif)

# About

IWE is a tool that helps you organize your markdown notes. It treats notes as an interconnected graph, where each document acts as a sub-tree and the links are the edges connecting them. It supports various operations designed to assist with navigating and restructuring the graph.

The main focus of IWE is to help you to keep your notes organized. It works with the graph at the semantic level, understanding the **headers**, **lists** and **links** defined structure of the documents.

> A simple analogy for software engineers would be an IDE for markdown notes.

IWE functions in two modes:

1.  **Editor Extension Mode** (LSP server)

    IWE integrates seamlessly with your editor, letting you navigate documents, search, auto-complete links, and a whole lot more, like:

    - Searching through your notes
    - Following markdown links
    - Auto-completing links
    - Extracting or inlining a sub-note
    - Formatting the document and updating link titles
    - Selecting backlinks (find links that reference the current document)
    - Transforming lists into headers and vice versa
    - Showing inlay hints with parent note references and link counts

2.  **Command Line Utility Mode**

    This tool lets you process thousands of documents in just a second. With IWE, you can reformat documents and update link titles across your entire library. You can also use the CLI mode to combine multiple files into one extended document.

## Text editor extension features

### Extract/Inline Notes

The extract note action enables the creation of a new document from a list or a section (header) This involves:

1.  Creating a new file containing the selected content.
2.  Replacing the original selected content with a link to the newly created file.

The reverse operation, known as **inline**, allows you to:

- Inject the content back into the original document, replacing the link and removing the file.

Both operations automatically adjust the header levels as needed to maintain proper document structure.

### Navigation

IWE supports multiple way to navigate  your documents, including:

- **Links Navigation**: Implement as Go To Definition LSP command
- **Table of Contents**: Provided as Document Symbols to the editor
- **Backlinks List**: A backlinks list compiles references or citations linking back to the current document

### Search

Search is one of the key features. IWE, creates all possible document paths by considering the block-references structure. This means it can come up with lists like:

```
Readme - Features
Readme - Features - Navigation
Readme - Features - Search
..ets
```

And provide this list to your text editor as Workspace Symbols.

This allows for context-aware fuzzy searching, making it easier for you to find what you need.

The search results are ordered by page-rank which is based on the number of references to the target note.

### Text structure normalization / formatting

LSP offers **auto-formatting**, which typically kicks in when you save your work. This feature helps tidy things up. Here's what gets cleaned up:

1.  Uprating link titles to the header of the linked document
2.  Adjusting header levels to ensure tree structure
3.  Cleaning up dead links by replacing them with title text
4.  Updating the numbering of the ordered lists
5.  Fixing newlines, indentations in lists, and much more

### Inlay hints

Inlay hints showing the number of references to the current document and the list of parent documents

### Auto-complete

IWE can suggest links as you type.

### Text manipulation

IWE offers a range of actions to help you perform context-aware transformations on your notes. The actions can be called with "code actions" LSP menu of your editor. Some of the actions available are:

- Transforming list to headers/section
- Transforming subsequent of the same level to list
- Changing list type (bullet/ordered)

### Header levels normalization

IWE interprets nested structure created by the headers. It understands the relationships between the header. For example:

``` markdown
# First header

## Second header
```

`Second header` is sub-header of the first one. Markdown allows any headers structure. Including the cases where nesting cannot be interpreted. Like:

``` markdown
## First header

# Second header
```

IWE atomically fixes header levels for enforce correct nesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

IWE can also normalize the headers structure dropping unnecessary hedaer-levels, For example:

``` markdown
# First header

### Second header
```

Will be normalized into dropping unnecessary levels.

``` markdown
# First header

## Second header
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First header of the document/section determines zero-level. In this case it is set to level 3 so all subsequent headers are going to be adjusted to follow the starting point.

``` markdown
### First header

## Second header

### Third header
```

Will result in:

``` markdown
# First header

# Second header

# Third header
```

## CLI features

- **Normalize**: Standardizes the graph data and ensure consistency.
- **Paths**: Retrieves and displays all possible paths within the graph.
- **Squash**: Creates a document by simplifying the structure and embedding referenced documents

### Usage

You can run `iwe` using the following syntax:

``` sh
iwe [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
```

#### Global Options

- `-v`, `--verbose <verbose>`: Sets the level of verbosity. Default is `0`.

#### Commands

- `iwe init`: Initialize the directory as documents root by adding `.iwe` marker directory and creating default `config.json` in it
- `iwe normalize`: Standardizes the graph data to ensure a uniform structure
- `iwe paths`: Lists all the paths present in the graph
- `iwe squash`: Traverse the graph to the specified  depth combining nodes into single markdown document
  - `-d`, `--depth <depth>`: Depth to squash to. Default is `2`

> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure that you have a copy of you files before you perform bulk-action such as `iwe normalize`.

#### Normalize command

This command will performs batch normalization of the entire library. Including:

- Uprating link titles to the header of the linked document
- Adjusting header levels to ensure tree structure
- Updating the numbering of the ordered lists
- Fixing newlines, indentations in Lists
- etc.

#### Squash command

IWE can "project" the graph into a single document by changing block-references into subsections (headers) and directly incorporating the block-references into the parent document.

## Nested documents

IWE has some cool features, like its support for nested documents through block-references. This is a type of [transclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion), where a sub-document is seamlessly incorporated into a parent document. Transclusion lets you reuse the same content across various contexts, making your work more efficient and interconnected.

With IWE, you can treat these block-references like embedded notes. This means you can build complex, layered document structures without having to deal with massive markdown files.

- **[Block-reference](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/blob/master/readme.iwe/block-reference.md)** is a key building block for the documents graph

  In markdown, it's a paragraph that contains one link to a note. Like this:

  ``` markdown
  A paragraph...

  [Block-reference](block-reference)

  Another paragraph...
  ```

After you've organized your notes, IWE lets you merge them into one cohesive document. It automatically adjusts the header levels of the embedded documents based on where they're referenced in the main document.

See [readme.iwe/README](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/blob/master/readme.iwe/README.md) which is source for this file.

## How to install

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can get them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

### Installation

Clone the repository, navigate into the project directory, and build the project:

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:iwe-org/iwe.git
cd iwe
cargo build --release
```

This will create an executable located in the `target/release` directory.

### Editors

IWE can be used with any text editor with LSP support. IWE contains a special LSP binary called `iwes`.

#### VIM integration

To enable IWE LSP for markdown files in VIM you need to make sure that `iwes` binary is in your path and add this to your config:

``` lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {
  pattern = 'markdown',
  callback = function(args)
    vim.lsp.start({
      name = 'iwes',
      cmd = {'iwes'},
      root_dir = vim.fs.root(args.buf, {'.iwe' }),
      flags = {
        debounce_text_changes = 500
      }
    })
  end,
})

-- optional, enabled inlay hints
vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable(not vim.lsp.inlay_hint.is_enabled())
```

And create `.iwe` directory as a marker in you notes root directory.

It works best with [render-markdown.nvim](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim/tree/main)

#### Visual Studio Code

Contributors are welcome.

## Configuration

IWE doesn't have much configuration options at the moment, but it does come with some sensible defaults.

For instance:

- Whenever a document is generated, it automatically gets a random file name made up of 8 alphanumeric characters.
- Links are generated without file extensions, with the default being `.md`.

If you'd like to tweak anything, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

The only configuration options available lets you change the default extension for local links and the path where you want to keep the files (relative to current directory). For example:

``` json
{
  "markdown":{"refs_extension":".md"}
  "library":{"path":"readme.iwe"}
}
```

By default, the extension is omitted.

## Help needed

The IWE project is a work in progress and there's plenty of room for improvement. Check out the issues for specific areas that need attention. Help with documentation or editors integration is welcomed!
