# IWE - Markdown LSP server

# About

IWE is a tool that helps you organize your markdown notes. It treats notes as an interconnected graph, where each document acts as a sub-tree and the links are the edges connecting them. It supports various operations designed to assist with navigating and restructuring the graph.

The main focus of IWE is to help you to keep your notes organized. It works with the graph at the semantic level, understanding the **headers**, **lists** and **links** defined structure of the documents.

IWE functions in two modes:

1.  **Editor Extension Mode** (LSP server)

    IWE integrates seamlessly with your editor, letting you navigate documents, search, auto-complete links, and a whole lot more, like:

    - Searching through your notes
    - Following markdown links
    - Auto-completing links
    - Extracting or inlining a sub-note
    - Formatting the document and updating link titles
    - Selecting backlinks (find links that reference the current document)
    - Transforming lists into headers and vice versa
    - Showing inlay hints with parent note references and link counts

2.  **Command Line Utility Mode**

    This tool lets you process thousands of documents in just a second. With IWE, you can reformat documents and update link titles across your entire library. You can also use the CLI mode to combine multiple files into one extended document.
