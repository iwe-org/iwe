# Text structure normalization / formatting

LSP offers **auto-formatting**, which typically kicks in when you save your work. This feature helps tidy things up. Here's what gets cleaned up:

1.  Uprating link titles to the header of the linked document
2.  Adjusting header levels to ensure tree structure
3.  Cleaning up dead links by replacing them with title text
4.  Updating the numbering of the ordered lists
5.  Fixing newlines, indentations in lists, and much more
