# Debug Mode

IWE includes a debug mode, which can be enabled by setting the `IWE_DEBUG` environment variable. In debug mode, IWE LSP will generate a detailed log file named `iwe.log` in the directory where you started it. Including logs with your [issue](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/issues) report will help us to resolve it faster.

```
export IWE_DEBUG=true; nvim
```
