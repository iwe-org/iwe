# Extract/Inline Notes

The extract note action enables the creation of a new document from a section (header). This involves:

1.  Creating a new file containing the selected content.
2.  Adding a [](block-reference.md) link to the newly created file.

The reverse operation, known as **inline**, allows you to:

1.  Embed the content into the document with [Block-reference](block-reference.md).
2.  Remove the link and injected file.

Both operations automatically adjust the header levels as needed to maintain proper document structure.
