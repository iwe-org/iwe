# Text manipulation

IWE offers a range of actions to help you perform context-aware transformations on your notes. The actions can be called with the "code actions" LSP menu of your editor. Some of the actions available are:

- Transforming lists to headers/sections and vice-versa.
- Changing list type (bullet/ordered).
- Sorting list items.
