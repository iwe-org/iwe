# Design principles

IWE is text graph management assistant. Any text graph. The graph structure is not imposed.

- Do not assume any particular graph structure or file naming convention.

  It is up to the user to decide on these details.

- The goal is to minimize routine operations.

  Keeping the graph consistent should require the least possible amount of effort. The text formatting need's to be automated.

- Focus on building blocks, not specific features.

  All simple operations as a "daily note" can be implemented at the editor level. IWE is merely a tool for navigating and changing text graphs.
