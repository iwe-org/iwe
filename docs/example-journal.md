## Week 3 - Coffee week

This week, I tried three types of coffee: the **cappuccino** with its bold espresso and frothy milk offering a delightful texture, the **latte** which envelops espresso and milk in a comforting embrace perfect for leisurely mornings, and the **cortado**, a balanced blend of espresso and milk that brings peace to the taste buds.

### Jan 26, 2025 - Cappuccino

It's cappuccino day. The classic Italian masterpiece, where espresso meets a frothy cloud of milk, creating a delightful contrast of bold and creamy. It's like sipping on a caffeine-infused cloud, perfect for anyone wanting to add a little texture to their daily routine.
### Jan 25, 2025 - Latte

As warm as a hug from an old friend, the latte wraps espresso and milk in a snug embrace. With a canvas for barista art, itâ€™s not just a drink, but a little piece of serenity in a cup for those more leisurely mornings when taking it slow is the only option.

### Jan 24, 2025 - Cortado

I had an amazing cortado today. It's when espresso and milk meet halfway in a charming truce, the cortado emerges. It's the perfect compromise, bringing balance to your coffee routine and peace to your taste buds.

As a result of this decomposition, each document is much simpler while the original hierarchy is preserved. It's also a perfectly valid markdown with no additional syntax.

IWE support automated actions for graph transformations like this and it can just as easily reconstruct the **original** document buy combining the extracted content together preserving correct headings structure.
